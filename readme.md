**Project Description: Rentify**

Rentify is a comprehensive web application designed to address the challenges faced by both property owners and tenants in the real estate market. Built with MongoDB, Python Flask, and Angular, Rentify offers a seamless experience for property listing, tenant search, and communication between property owners and potential renters.

**Overview:**
As the world emerges from the pandemic, the demand for rental properties is surging, making it challenging for both property owners and tenants to navigate the market efficiently. Rentify aims to bridge this gap by providing a platform where property owners can list their properties and tenants can search for suitable rentals based on their preferences.

**Tech Stack:**
Rentify utilizes MongoDB as its database, Python Flask for the backend, and Angular for the frontend. This tech stack offers flexibility, scalability, and robustness to the application, ensuring a smooth user experience.

**Key Features:**

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Users can register as either property owners or tenants, providing their basic information such as first name, last name, email, and phone number.
   - Property owners have access to a dashboard where they can manage their property listings, including adding new listings, updating existing ones, and deleting listings if necessary.
   - Tenants can browse through the listed properties and express interest in properties they like.

2. **Property Listings:**
   - Property owners can list their properties by providing essential details such as location, area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, amenities, and nearby facilities like hospitals and colleges.
   - Tenants can view all the available rental properties, filter them based on their preferences, and explore detailed information about each property.

3. **Communication:**
   - Tenants can express interest in a property by clicking on the "I'm Interested" button, which triggers an email notification to the property owner.
   - Property owners receive notifications containing the details of interested tenants, enabling them to initiate communication and further discuss rental arrangements.

4. **Enhanced Features (Add-Ons):**
   - Mandated login for tenants adds an extra layer of security, ensuring that only authorized users can access property owner details.
   - A "Like" button on each property allows tenants to express interest in properties, and the like count is tracked live, providing valuable insights into property popularity.
